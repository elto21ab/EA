## The Standard Idea in Most Teaching:
==Bank principle==
ID most important theory and put them in storage
	Scales well
	Based on memory and repetition
	Need que to "withdraw from bank"
	Become narrow-minded = Inferior
	Misunderstanding / confusion is than internalising theory…
	Formalise, present, etc.

==Dialogue principle==
Extent the context and usability of ideas and concepts
	**Far superior**
	Theory is more than an isolated idea
	Remember by application
	Applicable rather than being a machine
	Trained via case-related teaching

Throughout this course, we will recognise that we follow the principle of dialogue.

### Recap from Last Week
[[L3W7 - Changing the company from the inside out]]
___
**Social movements (SM)**
	Sandra Brown
	SM --> Corporate change
	Workers vs Mgmt
	Women…

#### ==SM framework==
**Questions needed to implement a SM**
Why - Opportunity
Why - Formality

How - Mobilising platforms

Top-down mgmt is needed in this example

#### ==Tempered radicals==
Self-expression: Challenge norms by displaying confidence in your "stance"
Verbal jujitsu: Turn argument around, so that the initial comment is actual used against the sender in an elegant argument.
Variable term opportunist: Something is better than nothing
Strategic alliance: Exchange "capitals" to improve power dynamics standpoint

## Case _Rema 1000_ - Knowledge Work
Franchise constellation is making general success hard, because sharing know-how and competitive tips in between other Rema 1000 a disadvantage for themselves.

All knowledge work is happening behind the scenes in mgmt. and

### Strategy
___
- Franchise (Less risky investment): Owner fee 7%
	- Location-, mgmt-, marketing-, supply chain support
		- Location: Corporate help with finding and financing commercial real-estate
		- Mgmt:
			- HR - standardised contracts, etc
			- Legal issues
			- Training owner(s) to operate stores
		- Marketing
		- Supply chain
	- Mobile first
		- Run shop from smartphone
	- Customer is king
		- Spend time with daily operations rather than "back-office tasks"
		- Low cost
		- Local connections create brand loyalty
		- Product selection and display
			- Suppliers fight for shelf-space
	- Performance focused
		- Store management
		- Cut-off 3-4% every year from franchise program

Why don't every grocery stores become franchises?
	Financial perspective
		Loose profit
			More incentives to not have a middle-man
		Hard to find fair fee
		Accepting 3-4% failures and having good bail-out practices is hard
	Branding perspective
		Corporate branding can have advantages and disadvantages:
		E.g., Dominos

### Pros/cons Of Implementing Workplace in Rema 1000
___
| Pros                           | Cons                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Horizontal advice              | Information overload & duplication                                |
| Access to more info and ideas  | FaceBook algorithm success criteria: More time on platform > less |
| Communication to mgmt./workers | Hierarchy jumping                                                 |
| Consolidation                  | SoMe related rather than workspace related                        |

**Workspace wrong solution for Rema 1000**
Designed for smaller team-based operations

Avoid fading into becoming IT company
	They want standardised easy-to-implement solution rather than redesigning own intranet

### How to Ensure Best Use of Workplace - Best Practices
____
==Posting guidelines== of what and how to post
==Admin rights== for creating groups
==Curation mechanism== - so flagged posts don't harm value
Moderation?
	Not happening

==The way Rema 1000 handled it==

___
Knowledge is used everywhere, across all types of businesses

Good / well functioning technology become invisible to the user. The sophisticated ways than complexity gets implemented into everyday tools.

## Today's PP
____
"Tech can facilitate but not replace"

### Modes of knowledge
**Ways to think about knowledge work**
4 operationalisations
	Tacit - explicit
		Tacit = knowledge you have
	Esoteric - trivial
		Electricity is trivial = you don't think about the magic going on
	Personal - collective
		The individual is the key barrier who carry the knowledge, but the exchange is carried out and perfected in collective communities.
	Sticky - leaky
		Knowledge is not shared in optimal ways

**Sticky vs leaky**

| Sticky                                      | Leaky                |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Knowledge is not shared                     | External             |
| Stick around in silos                       | Porous boundaries    |
| Create spaces of relative ignorance         | Overshared knowledge |
| Best practices get stuck rather than shared | - Competitors, regulators, NGOs, internal overload                     |

### Xerox R&D
Xerox created the internet and invented the computers. Now they only create foto-copiers. But they could not sell the systems. --> Xerox became the place to steal knowledge, because they leaked knowledge, while they should have considered their knowledge a strategic resource they should protect.

_Why could they create but did not sell it?_
- Timing: Ahead of their time
- Lacked sales organisation (owned by IBM)
- Was not a gold-mine until others started to exploit

## Knowledge: a Practice view
How: Commercialise
Who: Make sure it gets out to the right hands

	ID + Knowledge = Community of practise

## Community of Practice

No individual have all knowledge --> and should therefore get accessed in community
Social learning - based on dialogue

Community of practice know how to resolve tension of leaky/sticky knowledge --> to make it stick within the organisation, but make it leak out to all members.

## L4W9 - Don’t Be Evil_Reading

### Bing Summary

The paper by Dan Kärreman and Mats Alvesson¹ explores how media organizations deal with ethical issues and dilemmas. It argues that **media organizations often create a sense of ethical closure, which means that they avoid or justify unethical actions by using various discursive strategies**. The paper identifies ==four types of ethical closure: ethical sealing, ethical bracketing, double dehumanization, and commodification.== The paper also discusses the implications of ethical closure for organizational practice and research.

### Bing Roleplay

Professor B: So, in my paper, I used a qualitative approach to _analyze four cases of ethical closure in media organizations. I looked at how they used discursive strategies to avoid or justify unethical actions._

Professor A: And what did you find?

Professor B: I found that _ethical closure was prevalent and pervasive in media organizations. It affected their moral consciousness and their professional identity. It also had implications for their accountability and legitimacy._

#### Critical of Sources

Professor A: That sounds very plausible. _But how do you measure or quantify ethical closure?_ How do you compare different cases or contexts?

Professor B: That's a good question. Ethical closure is not easy to measure or quantify. It depends on the interpretation and evaluation of various stakeholders. It also varies across time and space.

Professor A: So how do you increase the empirical content of your theory? How do you make it more falsifiable or testable?

Professor B: Well, one way is to use multiple methods and sources of data. For example, I could use surveys or experiments to complement my interviews and observations. I could also use different theoretical frameworks or perspectives to challenge my assumptions.

Professor A: That sounds reasonable.

Professor B: Another way is to apply my theory to different domains or sectors. For example, I could look at ethical closure in other types of organizations, such as health care or education. I could also look at ethical closure in other countries or cultures.

Professor A: That sounds interesting.

Professor B: Finally, a third way is to engage with other researchers and practitioners who are interested in ethical issues and dilemmas. For example, I could collaborate with colleagues from different disciplines or fields who have different views or experiences on ethics. I could also participate in workshops or conferences where I can present and discuss my findings with others.

Professor A: That sounds productive.

Professor B: By doing these things, I hope to increase the empirical content of my theory and make it more valuable for application.

### Defining Elements of Paper

The paper by Dan Kärreman and Mats Alvesson¹ defines the four closures as follows:

- **Ethical sealing (Closure):**

    The process of creating a moral boundary around the organization or its members, which separates them from others who are seen as immoral or inferior. This creates a sense of superiority and legitimacy for the organization or its members.

- **Ethical bracketing:**

    The process of suspending or ignoring ethical considerations in certain situations or contexts, which are seen as exceptional or unavoidable. This creates a sense of necessity and rationality for the organization or its members.

- **Double dehumanization:**

    The process of denying or reducing the humanity of both oneself and others who are involved in unethical actions. This creates a sense of detachment and indifference for the organization or its members.

- **Commodification:**

    The process of treating ethical issues and dilemmas as commodities that can be traded, exchanged, or sold. This creates a sense of pragmatism and opportunism for the organization or its members.

The paper focuses on media organizations, which are part of the media industry. The media industry is a broad term that covers various sectors that produce, distribute, or consume information and entertainment content, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television, film, music, books, games, etc.
