## Last Lecture Recap
**Elon musk**
- CEO celebrity --> Personal relationship
- Bully in use
	- Humiliating/delimitating/intimidating employees
	- Oppose traditional paradigm about leadership ("good" consensus)
	- Celebrate people bullying for us, due to its useful outcome

Is this a sustainable leadership practice? Self-destructive, but somehow still praised

## This Lecture
### Summary of Articles
Brief bulletpoints comparing the two articles:
- "*Problems, problems, problems: The social construction of 'leadership*'" by Keith Grint¹³ argues that leaders are not passive observers of the context, but ==active constructors== of it. He proposes a model that distinguishes between tame, wicked, and critical problems, and suggests different types of leadership and compliance for each. He applies this model to three case studies of asymmetric conflicts: the invasion of Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the Northern Ireland peace process. He concludes that leaders need to be more aware of how they frame the problems and how they influence the followers' perceptions and actions.
- *"Intergroup leadership"* by Todd L. Pittinsky and Stefanie Simon⁴⁵ introduces the concept of allophilia, or positive intergroup attitudes, as a key factor for effective intergroup leadership. They define intergroup leadership as the ability to mobilize followers from different groups toward a common goal that transcends group boundaries. They propose a framework that identifies four dimensions of intergroup leadership: intergroup vision, intergroup relations, intergroup coordination, and intergroup learning. They illustrate this framework with examples of successful intergroup leaders from various domains, such as politics, business, education, and sports. They suggest that intergroup leaders need to foster allophilia among their followers and among themselves.
- Some *similarities* between the two articles are: they both address the challenge of intergroup conflict and cooperation; they both offer theoretical models and practical examples of leadership; they both emphasize the role of leaders in shaping the followers' attitudes and behaviors; they both draw on interdisciplinary perspectives and empirical evidence.
- Some *differences* between the two articles are: they focus on different types of problems (tame, wicked, or critical vs. intergroup); they adopt different approaches to leadership (contingency vs. positive); they propose different sources of compliance (coercion, calculation, or normative vs. allophilia); they have different scopes of analysis (asymmetric vs. symmetric conflicts).

### Intergroup Relationship (Leadership)

> [!note]
> 2nd half of case is less relevant than the 1st half

#### In-/out-group Dynamics
Wherever you have leadership you have in-/out-group dynamics
| Pros                       | Cons                                                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Work towards a common goal | Sub-groups unhealthy competition that harms collaboration |
|                            | Un-intended strong/offensive reaction by out-group        |

#### Promote Contact
Encourage meetings to form fathomable relationship

#### Avoid 0-sum Games
Finite/scarce resources should be minimally wasted, to avoid reinforcing in-/out-group dynamics

#### Promote Superordinate IDs
*Enhance the superordinate ID, so it align most suitably with the circumstances.*
Don't classify narrowly defined groups, but rather label a higher degree of abstraction. E.g., not engineering team, but a part of the corporation

#### Promote Dual IDs
The employees are not an isolated entity.

#### Us and Them rather than Us Vs Them
*Recognize that these dynamics are present and deal accordingly*.
Group-cohesion focus is leaning too much into the in-group dynamic

## Case - Friendly Fire
**Military comms**
- Team-work training
- Accountability: Everyone is responsible = no one is
	- Classical bureaucratic trait
- Supervisor elevated in order to specialize --> less common terminology
- Assumptions lead to action and mistakes
- Unusual hierarchy where autonomy is prioritized?

### Qs for the case
**Why did the F-15 pilots see what they saw**?
- IFF-system
	- Misunderstood spamming = Hostile jamming
	- Failed comms between airforce and army of switching to IFF frequencies in no-flight-zone airspace
- Tricker-happy: Excited to see enemies
	- Since they didn't respond
	- They were on different radio channels
- Framing (assumptions)
	- F-15 all sweeps (expectation of being alone in the airspace)
- Trained to ID helis from below
- No training on friendly helis
- No comms
- Sponsors

**Why did no one in the AWACS intervene**?
- Immature crew (Wilson Roobie --> Enroute-guy)
	- Training and coordination
- Poorly defined chain-of-command hierarchy
- Pilots are on top of the food chain
	- Meanwhile every other function are supportive
	- Min. comms
	- No need for permission
- Lack of initiative from both sides (no comms)
- Inconsistent vocabulary
- Nudge/gesture unavailable in comms-central
- F-15s usually intercept and operate in higher altitude than helis' airspace

**What are the root causes of the shootdown**?
- Miscommunication
	- New implementation of IFF
		- Lack of updating for Blackhawks
		- Lack of briefing for F-15s
	- Lacking initiative in-action
- Circumstances
	- On edge
	- Budget cut-backs
	- poor training
	- Motivation
- Culture
	- Knowledge sharing
	- Conflict between army and airforce
	- Complacency:
		- Self-satisfaction especially when accompanied by unawareness of actual dangers or deficiencies.
	- Ignorance
		- Functional stupidity:
			- Trained this way, to act quicker

**Whom would you hold accountable? Why**?
- The enroute controller
	- Lacked to inform about the no-flight-zone to the Blackhawks
	- The guy who trained the controller
- F-15s Wilson
	- Breach rules of engagement by being in same altitude as helis
- Institution = Not acceptable answer
- Webson and the air traffic controller's May comms
- Commander (highest up) or the President
- Senior director Wang
	- Supposed to coordinate the in between comms
- Pilkingson?
- Duke?

> [!caution]
	"Its okay to not know and delegate, but not to not know that you don't know".
	- Single point of failure, and then contributing factors.
	- With what we know, something was going to fail, because the organization wasn't properly designed.

#### What Actually Happened
- Letter of reprimand
	- The enroute controller
	- Wilson
	- Pilkington
- All blame fell on
	- Wang (tendency to fall asleep)

#### Cause Sum-up
**Complacency and ignorance**

## The Social Construct of Leadership
What is social construction?
	The interpretation and purpose of a "thing"
	Emerge out of social processes
	Negotiated reality of society about what things should mean
		Is most of the time predetermined previous to our timeframe
	Everything can be socially constructed theoretically, if taken into abstract depths.

	Internalize via socialization adaption.
	The perspective of the objects/materials is based on its affordances.

## **Social constructionism**
- Constructs of social reality Concepts
	- Institutions
	- Artifacts
- Outcomes
	- Social reality construction Interaction
	- Processes

**The social constructionist perspective on leadership**
leadership is not inevitable
leadership is an interpretation
leadership can be transformed
actual leadership is less optimal

*Problems, problems, problems* - Framing situations
- Everything is constructed:
	- Leaders
	- Followers
	- Context

**Typology of problems (Grint '5**)
	![[Pasted image 20230413165428.png|500]]
- Tame problems (Mgmt)
- Critical problems (Command)
	- More important to have action – regardless of outcome – than inaction
- Wicked problems (Leadership)
	- No definitive formulation
	- No stopping rules
	- Only relative solution
	- Solutions are not testable
	- Can only be partially resolved
**Problem framing**
- Not a given
- Process of persuasion
- Inherently political
	- E.g., how ;
		- pandemic was treated relative to contextual scenarios (Aids in the 80s)
		- climate change (wicked problem?)
- Contingent of resources and tech.
