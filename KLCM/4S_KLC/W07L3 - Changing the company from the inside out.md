## In Class
____
### Last 2 Weeks:
**Different assumptions of mgmt and workers**
MGMT:
	Mgmt know best
	Workers follow instructions
	Workers lack motivation
	Workers are motivated by money and they are all replacable
	Workers should be happy, since mgmt is providing them better opportunities
	Hierarchy and rules
	Anyone can do the work
Workers:
	Mgmt are clueless
	Top-down communication
		*Suggestion books are not used*
	Lack of trust
	Workers know best
	Mgmt can make things harder (than necessary)

| Mgmt assumptions | Workers assumptions |
| ------- | ---- |
| ------- | ---- |
|         |      |

**Opposing systems perspectives**,
- Systems-control (Basis foundation, provides the vocabulary necessary to grasp leadership and mgmt-theory)
	- Machine
	- Rooted in modernist thinking
	- Org. is and ==organism==, like an animal, working together interlinked
		- Erase all friction within through "==org.-goals=="
	- Mgmt design and run next it on the side.
	- "Scientifically validated through evidence"
	- Raised productivity, but at a cost.
- Process-relation (Superior version of how one should undstand_, because you can take more complexity into account)
	- ==Strategic exchanges== creates a ==negotiated order==
	- E.g., task/projects and goals relationship
		- An org. is changing through all of the complex intermediate "transactions" happening when a variety of entities clash together in a common task at hand, but are attaching different goals (ideologies) to the process of the same task.
	- People are always in the process of becoming who they want to become through the micro exchanges they do.
	- ==Implicit contracts==

| Systems-control | Process-relations |

___

Systems-control can exist inside of process-relation.

Analogy example is Russian vs. Ukrainian army

_Relational-leadership theory_

___

### Today's PP
___
**The transparency paradox**
Improved vision for both observer and observed --> increased awareness of being observed.

==Reverse Hawthorne effect== (human-relations mgmt-theory)
	Ordinary _Hawthorne effect_ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawthorne_effect)
		Both Incr. and decr. lightning improves productivity, contrary of the 2 opposing each other. Because mgmt started to care.
	Whereas Reversed Hawthorne effect is when it does not attract the desired result.

"_Cooks makes tastier food when they can see the customers_" vs "The cooks makes worse food when the customer looks over their shoulder"

**Performance boost of privacy** (10-15%)
Explanation
	Experimental
	Less interruptions
However, more productivity variation

**Nut-case version of systems-control perspective**
Management going crazy on optimisation provided an incentive for division, and essentially gave birth to the anti-work/silent-quitting movement.

____

"The pandemic revealed office-workers to how enslaved they are" - bc of the system-control perspective

___
Break
___

## Case

**What did Sandra Brown do to promote change?**
Theory
	Strategic alliance building and Verbal jujitsu ^1
	She took the opportunity when social movement framework was suitable for organisational innovation ^2
		Mobilised availability of ICT makes in conceivable to contact CEO
		Network and Opportunity made ally-op

Practical
	Wrote e-mail to CEO --> without response
	Informed/talked to colleagues (freakout)
	Snowball-effect
	*Undercut boss* (manager) in fear that he wouldn't convey her message as intended to the CEO

**How was digital tech and SoMe used?**
	Website, #'s
	To gather the movement together

**Should she take Gupta's job offer?**
	She did in part b - what i read

## ==The Realm of speculation==
___

### Other Possible Scenarios
___
_How should the CEO have responded?_
Every action from the CEO conveys a message and sends a statement. However, inaction also sends signals of priority and stance on diversity.

Make secretary respond in a bureaucratic and appreciating way:
	"Thx 4 reaching out, we r forming a committee for this exact challenge"

_How could she've increased her chances for a response?_
High risk-high reward - force answer by CC'ing other employee(s). --> would likely make her in the spotlight as a problematic employee. Which she is apparently committed enough to pursue anyway, without knowledge of CEO, by her colleague-freakout.

### Movement
___
Social movement, _WomenNIN_
- Got organic hype without having a "leader"

Why didn't they mention other women?
	a
		Leadership-case of having a protagonist.
		Sort of goes against "social movement" fundamentals, but her image needs to be inspiring.
	b
		Afraid to associate with that message.
		Other women involved, but case does not consider them significant enough to introduce a single one.

## Changing the World from the inside out - _Overview of the Social Movement Framework_
___

| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Definition    | Opportunity structure                                          | Framing mechanism   | Social Networks                              | Mobilised platform                                                                                                       |
| Generic       | Tech/SoMe made her reach significant (relative to older times) | MeToo, BLM, etc.    | You need to have connections to force change | Vehicle for driving it. Movements where there isn't a "Ghandi" to be the face of it. E.g., the black church and FB, etc. |
| Case relation | New CEO ask for input. Change of mgmt opened an opportunity.   | _Taking our chance_ | ?Sandra Brown's colleagues?                  | "Chatty", the SoMe platform mentioned in the case. Not push, but by pulling.                                             |

### _Block The spread_-movement (also an Advertisement campaign)
___
Mgmt see value in that movement, but it still gets resistance due to Sandra Brown being the corporate driver for it.
"The coach needs to be coached by her"

Mgmt considered it "==push==" because she already pushed some discourses around outside their control.
- She seeks external recognition for movement to avoid internal resistance.
- Alienated; by bragging about her rewards, etc. she received from outside.
- ==In-group vs out-group dynamic== of her "claiming ownership" for her rewards.
	- Fundamentally unrelated to gender
	- In
- Initial e-mail put a target on her own head, since she already caused friction within the company.

___
**Sidenote:**
	"It is a mistake to think everyone in wants the org. to succeed. They just want to promote themselves."
	Limited conception of binary gender (sex?) presented in this case. Disqualifying the broader spectrum of individualism forced upon by defining gender as a socio-cultural construction-

## Tempered Radicals
____
Relation to case:
	All examples from the article was in a more influential position of power, in oppose to Sandra Brown. If She was at the executive level, like the black banker, she might have had more authority to bring to battle.

| Term       | Disruptive Self-Expression                                                       | Verbal Jujitsu                                                                                                                               | Variable-Term Opportunism                                                            | Strategic alliance building     |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Definition | Putting yourself out there as an example (Giraffe-ish)                           | Uno-reverse micro-verbal confrontations. Small jabs                                                                                          | Any opportunity should be exploited, even though it only marginally reach a sub-goal | More is better than less people |
| Example    | Low-practical: Colouring your hair. Indirect: Picking up trash next to trash can | Turning a situation where someone gets undermined, into a confrontation of them being rude by exemplifying themselves in a contrary scenario | Take the little finger… you'll get the arm later                                   | Tribe-animals                   |

Tempered radicals are sort of like having a mixed identity, similar to kids of mixed parents - 3rd culture kids.
