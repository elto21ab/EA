### Recap - Last Lectures case
Rema 1000 using workplace --> Knowledge sharing

[^1] FB algorithm is based on engagement

To address the cons here [[L4W8 - Knowledge and Organization#How to ensure best use of workplace - Best practices]]
Solution
- Post guidelines
- Organize group authority (admin)

"Rema" is the company that should be careful about what they ask for. If they implement FB software for knowledge mgmt, they'll suck as much as them.

FB's Workplace push what people are interested in.

>**Utilitarian** framework --> Consequentialism
>>Stakeholder-analysis: Figuring out who stakeholders are.
>
>**Deontological** framework --> Principle/values (Ethics is outside of these frameworks)
>
>Culture <-> Communitarian framework
>>Different communities can overlap in demands and opting-out can have consequences.
>
>Contract --> Commitments
>>Am I living up to my commitments?
>
>Emotive --> Feelings
>> Does this feel right? Or am I shitty

## iPhone case
### Summary
With authority FBI requested Apple to open iPhone of theorist. Gave up all information they were legally obligated to.
	FBI wanting access to user data from Apple to help investigation of bombers. Apple declined due to privacy boundaries, and the ethical dilemma of where to draw the line for mass spionage.

	FBI hacked into the phone anyway.

General issue: "Should government be able to force data extradition from tech-companies to support anti-terror efforts"

Contextual issue: "Develop backdoor for government to
investigate theorist attacks and mass shootings"

>Apple fighting tracking from Google & FB

### Debate: FBI Vs Apple
**Issue from Apple's POV**
- Damage essential value proposition
- Where to draw line
- As much of an greyzone from government side as data-leaks the other way
- Marketing opportunity
	- Privacy is a good business model
*Response doing conversation*
- Compromise values
- Not getting involved based on speculations
- Create iPhone only for US costumers? If we comply with your rules, we break the rules for every other customer-base.
	- What is stopping terrorists, Putin, etc. to utilize the surveillance tech in the wrong hands to do damage
- Imagine you're an theorist: Would you keep sensitive data on it?
- Undermine all customers / slippery slope as a result for power coming with a master key
- The solution requested have consequences.
- Moral hazard and security
- Security vs security, not security vs privacy

**Issue from FBI's POV**
- Consequences of not - Utilitarian
	- "The needs of many outweighs the needs of few"
	- Means to an end
- Possibility of bridging into further intel - Utilitarian
*Response doing conversation*
- Duty argument to protect the people
- Prevention for the sake of national security
- Undue burdens?
- The right to privacy isn't absolute. We need to protect democracy
- Reasonable doubt in case of… whatever
- Already have mass surveillance technology. Why stop here?
- iPhones are hackable anyway, its more of a cost-saving matter.

>**Best practice strategy forming arguments**
>Don't dig heals --> look at opponents best argument
>Give them premises
>>"We stand with you. But because we highly regard security, this is our stand." (change the meaning of their own premises, and what it has of causal relationships)

>Global nature of business is creating an unresolvable ethical dilemma

>EU protects citizens data in oppose to the US

[Political commentary of this case by Obama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjvX5zq7BXg)

- Freedom at certain constraint.
- Downplay government surveillance.

Later
- China TikTok concern, meanwhile letting Google & FB do all.

[Apple public values on privacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZmeZyDGkQ0)

- Can't have backdoor for the "good guys" only - "bad guys" could use that too.
