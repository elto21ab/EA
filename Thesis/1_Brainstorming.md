### Scheduled Roadmap
#### Step 1
Find topic proposals
#### Step 2
How to approach it

- Approach thesis via design thinking
	- Business model canvas vs design thinking vs traditional *approach/methodology*
		- BMC:
		- DT:
		- Traditional thesis:
- Hypothesis

#### Merge the steps
Create the matrix of topics with the topics as columns, and approaching methodology is rows.

>Even better: use topics for both columns and rows

### Matrix
1. Potential for exploring how NLP can enhance user interaction within multi-sided platforms.	
	1. Content consumption assistant; critical on your behalf
	2. Accelerating network effect launch + Value units for platforms
		1. NLP-bots **quick-start**
	3. ^ More "rich" data to enhance personalization. Predict consumption optimization more accurately with less content.
		1. Dating: qualitative data incl. in algorithmic matching
2. Analyzing how NLP and agentic simulations can be used to create more effective nudging strategies in networked environments.
	1. "Nudge-test optimization through NLP simulation"


- Nudging X Multi-sided platforms (NLP)
- Prototyping: *NLP-agentic simulation vs A/B testing*
	- Speeding up
	- Minimizing risk
