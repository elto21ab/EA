## Qs
30m Outline:
1. Open cards
2. Introducing #1 and #2

## As
- **#2**
- not sim expert
	- monte carlo
	- subfield "Info econ" do sim
	- Simulation doesn't say anything about IRL
	- Too many assumptions in vacuum (lake game theory)
- Easiest = case
	- otherwise too vague
	- Don't contribute anything broad science
	- Have concrete empirical subjects from the real world
- **#1**
- 4 types of Open inno platforms (from most to least engagement)
	- Open source
	- Inno department platform (ext coordinated by int)
	- Competition (uncoordinated)
	- App stores (binary approval)
- **#3**
- Computer based agency (IS subject)
- Do interview with focus group facilitators to benchmark implementation

## Side-note Tips
- General
	- Consider what you get rated on
		- And which types of work that you get credit from doing
			- Don't build a model --> use pre-trained
			- Focus on reflections on results instead
	- Qs 4 papers
		- What is the domain?
		- What is the problem?
		- What have been done?
		- What r we doing?
		- How does it contribute?
- What dissertation prep should consist of:
	- Who's supervisor?
	- Method to use and where to find data
	- What theories can be used?
- Bring from many disciplines
	- Think about audience as singular narrowly
	- No MSc or PhD do interplicinary
	- But you can use from one, but remember to present it to
