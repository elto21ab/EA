### **1**
How to best utilize and manage collective intelligence in modular software ecosystems (Chrome extensions, Wordpress plugins, Notion integrations)?
1. Integrating external ideas and development
2. The degree of gatekeeping versus openness

Effectively managing complexity of open innovation/user entrepreneurship
- Open or not â†’ if open, how to do it best?
- Small entities â†’ strategically approach/capitalize â†’ open innovation â†’ facilitated by big corps
- Ecosystem architectures (extensions, plugins, integrations, add-ons, user-ideasâ€¦)
	- E.g., *Google Chrome, Wordpress, Notion, Obsidian, VS code, Docker, Arc, Lego, CommaAI, Metaâ€™s PyTorch, OpenAIâ€™s GPTs, POEâ€™s bots, etc*.

### Ideas
1. Inno ecosystems â€“ Examples
	1. Ext idea tunnel --> public crowd voting --> int dev best (Arc)
	2. Ext dev direct integration (as in mail)
	3. Ext dev inspiration --> eval --> int integration (CommaAI unsupported cars)
	4. Int dev OSS --> ext eval/tinker --> int gatekeeping ext integration (Meta PyTorch)
2. Sim platforms
	1. Types of sims
		1. Monte Carlo: Random
		2. MaaSSim
3. NLP-agent focus groups

## Master Ideas Pitch Bullets

1. Innovation ecosystems: How to best utilize and manage collective intelligence in modular software ecosystems (Chrome extensions, Wordpress plugins, Notion integrations)?
	1. Integrating external ideas and development
	2. The degree of gatekeeping versus openness
	3. Potentially applying platform theories to gain a new understanding
2. Sim platforms: Simulating a multi-sided platform (potentially incl. Nudging, NLP-agents, network effects).
	1. We already found multiple pre-made Python platform simulation libraries, like MassSim f.e., which we are testing out now.
	2. We had a course about platforms, their dynamics and in addition we also have ties to founders of growing platforms, like Skin Bliss, Shouter and Double, if we find a way to utilize real data.
3. NLP-agent focus groups: Solving the inherent challenges of focus groups via NLP Agentic simulations.
	1. Create and test if simulating complex human interactions using NLP (such as GPT or a free locally hosted model) can partially solve the Empathize/Define parts of Design Thinking and help in discovery of fitting customer segments

### Knowledge and Contents
#### Ideation

	- ðŸ”¸ Testing new business models for mobility platforms
		- Feedback loops theory
		- Lock-in
		- Platform governance vs Platform opnenness
			- Potential NLP
		- Rules on Ride-pooling
		- Multihoming
	- Competition vs a Taxi Firm
	- [[Platform Competition]]
	- Marketing campaings
		- Using NLP
		- Very far fetched and hard to prove

## **3**
- Marketing
	- SoMe Posts
	- Benchmarking (ext. way of assessing if response aren't random)
		- Find focus group facilitator?
		- Find company willing to partner up â€“ who has data on particular customers
		- Characteristics --> Answers of IRL people
		- Comments from e.g., product hunt
	- Financing research project via CBS (to use GPT-4)
- Options scretched out
	- LLMs adopting personas to do market research
		- Good if you can get right answers
		- Implement is easy, evaluating responses are hard
			- *Ideal: >1000 IRL people with characteristics and answers (benchmark model against those*)
			- Pre-trained replace large scale ML
			- Any org. already know characteristics of their users/consumers
			- *Alt.: Scrape SoMe and deduct characteristics based on user history. Answer (target-value*)
				- Characteristics could simply be the post. No need to create a profile. Instead "u r the person who posted all of these: a. ; b. ; c."
			- > Synthetic
			- Manual assessment of output based on our intuition
				- Or from professional marketing professionals
			- Best having data ahead of time, otherwise post-evaluate
- Ambitious
	- Assessment might not be as accurate as we might like.
- Auto AI market research
