- Ecosystem architectures (extensions, plugins, integrations, add-ons, user-ideas…)
	- E.g., Google Chrome, Wordpress, Notion, Obsidian, VS code, Docker, Arc, Lego, CommaAI, Meta’s PyTorch, OpenAI’s GPTs, POE’s bots, etc. 
	- CraftTMS
- Concepts:
	- Software Ecosystem 
	- Open Innovation 
	- Modular Architectures

#Meeting/Jacob
- Hotswap design feasibility
- Industry standards in tech
- R&D value proposition

1. Wrapper (**Core orchestrating modular FOSS**)
	1. Open innovation
	2. Code reuse
	3. Value-added reseller
	4. Extensions

- #2.1 How orgs coordinate core-unit innovation by capitalizing on complex modularity
	- What is the success criteria for modular systems to be competitive against monolithic systems?
	- How to optimally balance general and specialized resources and capabilities in innovative R&D
	- Friction in core-interaction
- #5 Strategic facilitation of open innovation: Creating tech-synergies (benefiting commercial value-unit) in complex networks
- #6 Effectively managing complexity of open innovation
	- Open or not → if open, how to do it best?

Small entities → strategically approach/capitalize → open innovation → facilitated by big corps

### Answers
Ecosystem = Loaded theoretical concept
- Where 2 get data (*Empirical* investigation)
	- Public
	- comp
	- users
- Explore vs develop 
	- Approach/orientation
		- Practical (others): Local problem ID --> Instance of general problem (abstraction)
		- Theoretical (us): We however start from theoretical concept --> and want to explore
	- Theoretical study
	- Project proposal
- CI/CD/DevOps (Jacob) feedback loops - operational
	- Frameworks
		- Platform model vs org structure
- Measure/KPIs
	- Outcome: Success
	- Strategy

Recommend:
- Writing
	- Clear
	- commitment
