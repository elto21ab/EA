	- Samples
		- Probability Sampling
			- Simple random
			- Stratified random
				- Can have *skewing* sampling, since ratio is secondary
					- Depending on defining population of interest precisely; research boundaries of a market
			- Clustered random
				- What is the crux of interest?
				- ID and define the "problem"

Levels of measurement

"It depends"; always the answer 4 any biz Q

Most important: Clear line of argument, and get definitions right
>ID Problem --> What can we, and what will we do about it --> implications of proposed actions

Broken window theory X policing
1. Def
	1. Who r we policing?
	2. How much police is on the street?
	3. What r the crime rates?
	4. What is the "broken window" of interest?
	5. What is the population?
