#Case/Valve #Steam

## Readings
### Case
Problems
- I ID:
	- How do Valve handle silent quitting?
	- Could Valve adopt the nested circle structure of Zappo, to collaborate with other orgs?
- They ID
	- Hardware entry feasible?
	- How?
	- Manufacturing approach?
- In class takes
	- Power
		- Reliance on OS from hardware brands

**Case Prep Qs**:
- Why has Valve been so successful?
	- Capitalizing on emerging gaming trends
	- Mobilizing resources
		- Org structure suits agile dev
	- Low entry barriers
	- Others
		- Cost structure (no ext hardware/licensing) allow for more R&D
		- No reinventing wheels (standing on shoulders of giants)
		- Network effect
			- SoMe element
		- C2C market facilitation
			- Organic migration of users
		- Hiring (Counter team structure argument)
			- Right people, right time
		- Maintaining ppl
		- Board
			- Ppl run comp.
			- Leadership emerge organically
			- expertise authority
		- PC-centered gaming
			- Differentiated niche in gaming market
	- *Case argument*
		- Hire and keep the right ppl
		- Lack of hierarchy in software dev works for them in keeping them creative
	- Def. assumptions
		- Right ppl
			- Collaborate
			- Demanding
				- Other offers
		- 1st mover adv
			- could afford org-structure choice
				- Money is not a scarce resource
				- Like Novo Nordisk
			- Money is not an issue
				- Valve is engineer-oriented (idea-seeking) instead of business-head (seeking funding always)
				- Not the only scarce resource
- How would you describe the leadership dynamics and organisational structure at Valve?
	- Agile/dynamic flat org-structure
	- Others
		- Peer-rating performance
		- Self-mgmt holocracy
		- Hiring
			- Self-replicating
			- Non-diverse
				- Harms creativity
- Should Valve start producing hardware? Why or why not?
	- No. It would fundamentally change their org structure
	- Yes
		- Diversify and avoid Microsoft reliance
		- Create subsidiary disconnected from mother-org.

		- IP giants competition
		- Steam business model didn't face same challenges

### Theory
[Online Article](https://hbr.org/2016/07/beyond-the-holacracy-hype)

Example of Holacracy
	![R1607B_BIG_HOLACRACY|200](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2016/06/R1607B_BIG_HOLACRACY.png)

**Myths**
1. There's No Organizational Structure
2. Hierarchy No Longer Exists
3. Everything Is Decided by Consensus

**Anti-leaders(hip)**
Oppose formally assigned leaders, while not against leadership as a relational/socially constructed phenomenon.

### How to Introduce case
- Opinion (init discussion)
- Pivoted problem ID

### Engaging with case Method
- What's not in the case

## Leadership in Valve
>Before critique – of practicalities, etc. – it's necessary to def. how leadership is presented by case

Org --> Cabals --> leadership processes

- Attr. ID < characteristic of function
- Situational
	- Relevant expertise organically emerge leadership responsibilities
	- Social construct (persuasion)
- Flat hierarchy still allows for many [covert] layers of authority
