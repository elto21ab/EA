## Exam
- Stay on course track
	- Only use ext. material strategically/quickly if necessary
- How 2 write
	- Style from purdue
		- Passive ≠ good
		- Short, direct, active voice is easier (even though it can feel childish)
		- Write 1st person active voice unless it gets against point "I argue"
	- Crux: How u frame argument
	- Don't summarize case. But show u read it. That u got their intended point, your perceived point – but u can critique case as well.
	- Potential:
		- Eval arguments made in class
		- If opposing ideas 2 the ones discussed in class, make sure 2 entertain that point w/ classmate
	- Can provide perspective on how some (preferably 1) cases relate
		- Writing style
		- Challenge
		- Referring more than 1 for contrast is going to incr. difficulty and risk
	- Reference
		- Min.: Explain their argument before applying it, be specific on relevance
		- Make argument > descr. other theory/case
	- "When, Why, Who, How"
