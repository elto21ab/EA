## Meta
### Scope and Connection Points of Course
- Change = Social movements
- "Mgmt" 2 be biz school-ish
## Basecamp's Org Policy Segway
#Ethics
### Ethical Frameworks to Approach Dilemmas
>No single rational/reasoning system can ensure ethical values for all entities
### Contradictory
Rights Vs Wrongs
- R v W
- R v (sort of) W
- R v R
- W v W
	- Necessary evils --> "Interpersonal sensitivity"
### Complementary Perspectives
1. *Consequencetialist: Ok w/ likely consequences of action
	1. Essentially risk mgmt
	2. Stakeholder analysis
2. *Diontological*: My duty and rights of others
	1. Obligation to yourself and others
3. *Community-based approach*: Respecting community's norms
	1. [[tempered radicalism – change]]
4. My-, and my company's *commitments*

>Emotion/"Stomach reaction"/"Gut feeling" = Mix and match above 4 perspectives
>Common corp. duties: Fiduciary, property, fair, transparent
>Tests: Visibility, generality, suitability, legacy
>^"Gist"/crux of note

## Todays #Case/Apple
- Dilemma: Terror and privacy
- Comments:
	- Gov. dictating how rsrcs should be used, and what their value-proposition is
	- Analogy "Asking doctors 4 efficient way 2 kill ppl"
	- Compromise on vision
	- Integrity stance
		- Avoid slippery slope down Snowden-path
- Argument 4 backdoor:
	- Encryption by employer w/ work-phone or iCloud by Apple
- **Split-up class**: Legal v Engineering argument
	- 4
		- **Public interest**
			- National security
			- Safety of community and ppl
			- Improving gov relationship
		- Respecting community-norms
			- Tech share data; regardless of Apple's distinguishing value proposition
		- Non-permanent tool
			- Legal: Limit w/ warrant requirement
			- Image: Patch after using exploit/crack
	- Against
		- **Privacy**
			- Undermine security
			- More "hackie"
			- Rights
			- User-owned data (not Apple)
			- complex engineering
			- No obvious crime (fishing expedition)
			- *Desensitizes* against privacy
		- Commitment (R v sort of W)
		- Utilitarian

>ID Stakeholders -->
>
>Assumption: Either Self-interest or Ethical. Not true, a self-interest-perspective can qualify ethical decision making, because of nuanced overview.
>
>Consensus: Old ppl care about privacy – young don't
>	Taking psychology/emotion test to get job
>		Not your real answers (Vanilla persona): Corp. ID is another mask than backstage.
>		Reframing corp. intent
>		Arms-race
