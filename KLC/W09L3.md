## Crux of Last L
- Valve, go into hardware?
- Why did we read the case anyway?
	- Leadership still has 2 occur in non hierarchical orgs; process is important
	- Unconventional (leaderless) mgmt isn't plug-and-play everywhere; depends on BM
		- But relevant for creative industries

## This L
- Assembly line standardization

Self-org team types
1. Participative mgmt and industrial demo (EU)
2. Quality circles and continuous impr. (japan)
3. inno task forces, skunk works (US)

Structure of self-mgmt orgs
- constitutions, foundational rules
- teams (circles, pods, cabals)
	- self-mgmt and/or designed
- Roles
- distr. leadership

Structure (Myth 1 ref)
- Brokers; bottom-up alt. to top-down

Getting balance right
- inter-team cord.
- Role frag.
- adaptability vs standardization tradeoff
- How much adaptability do u need?

Individual [contribution] to leadership function (not characteristic trade of individual)

Check for conventional leadership discourse

## E: Mgmt Vs Line-workers Perspective
>Assumptions on manufacturing process and perception of other side
- Mgmt (Marty Cole)
	- Well oiled Machine
	- Implicit or explicit
		- Explicit
			- Continuous improvement via suggestion box
	- max productivity (safe/quality)
	- We make efficient processes
	- Perception of line-workers
		- inferior (inherently stupid)
		- Irreplaceable
		- lazy
		- human machines
			- Commodity
			- Storage
			- Resources
		- don't care about they're work; just money
- Line-workers (Jieliang Hao)
	- Not empathetic
	- they consider us commodity
	- Shared goal of efficiency; which mgmt doesn't get
	- No incentive
		- Don't share, bc that'll rm our breaks
		- Leverage shortcuts egoistically
	- "Rules r dead, ppl r alive"
	- We have 2 break rules 2 be efficient

*Liability vs adaptability*

---

systems-control (can be 2 simplified) vs process-relational approach

Low margins: contract manufacturing = labor arbitrage

subversion: Can't dictate behaviour w/ levers

Watson (Maslow): Anti motivation
*Needs* isn't alone. Consider *wants*
Strategic exchanges. Can't treat ppl as dogs w/ treats
